# WAAAVES
this is a test of an app that i created in processing 
which deals with an emulation of internal feedback generated by time base correctors reconstructing iterations of a loop through video signal 
plus some bonus reaction diffusion that popped in because i was sloppy with the integers
and also with a very quick and dirty gui
i would appreciate any input anyone would like to give me on how interacting with this gui makes them feel
thank you!
